		'Social media was a buzz when the Nova U series debuted and it’s not hard to see why. Carbon fiber construction and unique soundhole configuration contribute to its surprisingly bright tone. Ergonomic design featuring a thinner profile delivers a comfortable playability you can feel. For tone, playability, and quality, the Nova U series is a great choice.',

		'While design & price makes this Ukulele attractive for beginners, its features give it wide appeal. Players may notice a somewhat louder volume and more mellow sound than a standard body uke of similar build due to the 70 Pineapple Koa''s shape. Use of Koa (back and sides) help to lend a bright sound. Strings, picks, strap, capo and more are included.',

	    'The Flight Fireball is named after a well-known jet airplane.  The Flight Fireball EQ-A Tenor features a solid mango body with dyed maple appointments, including a rosette, comfort edge, and scalloped cutaway. The mango tree, most popular for its tasty fruit, also serves as a stunning tone wood, both in appearance and sound.  Mango has a sweet sound (pun intended) that is often compared to koa, while offering amazing grain patterns found with no other tone wood.  Check out the amazing Flight Fireball and see how sweet it is to fall in love with it!',
